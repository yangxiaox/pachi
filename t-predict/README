[ Test prediction rate of various Pachi components ]

Choose engine to test with:

   $ predict -e [patternplay|replay|dcnn] [pachi_args]

and the script will make it try to predict moves from game records.

Note: To change replay's speed/accuracy, adjust sampling:

   $ predict -e replay runs=n


[ Setup ]

Place sgf files to use in a t-predict/sgf directory (symlink ok too)
and convert them to gtp first (see tools/sgf2gtp*).
(script will be reading t-predict/sgf/*.gtp)
